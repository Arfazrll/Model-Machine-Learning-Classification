## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **Model Training & Visualization**
- Train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification.
- Visualize **training accuracy** and **loss** vs. **validation accuracy** and **loss** to monitor performance and identify overfitting or underfitting.

### 2. **Image Upload & Prediction**
- Upload an image using a simple widget.
- The uploaded image is resized, normalized, and fed into the model for prediction.
- Displays the uploaded image alongside its **predicted class label**.

### 3. **Class Mapping**
- Supports mapping predicted class indices to their respective **class names** for better interpretability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning model building and training.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress.
- **NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**: For development and experimentation.
