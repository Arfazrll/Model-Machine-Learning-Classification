# üñºÔ∏è Image Classification with Deep Learning


This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building, training, and deploying a deep learning model to classify images. The focus is on creating a user-friendly interface for uploading images and obtaining predictions using a trained model.

‚ú® Features
Model Training & Visualization:

The notebook includes training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
Visualizes training accuracy and loss vs. validation accuracy and loss to monitor performance and identify overfitting or underfitting.
Image Upload & Prediction:

Users can upload an image using a simple upload widget.
The uploaded image is resized, normalized, and fed into the model for prediction.
Displays the uploaded image alongside its predicted class label.
Class Mapping:

Supports mapping predicted class indices to their respective class names for better interpretability.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning model building and training.
Matplotlib for visualizing training progress.
NumPy for data manipulation.
Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation.
üìä Visualization
The notebook provides training and validation accuracy/loss graphs to help monitor model performance over training epochs.
